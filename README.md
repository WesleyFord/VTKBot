# VTKBot
A Discord bot designed to begin and carry out vote to kick events. Removes users once a vote threshold is met. Invites the users back after being kicked.

A Discord bot key is necessary to run this. You can generate this using the Discord developer portal, under applications and selecting the bot type.
